## About This Project
I want to make a connect four engine that can beat me in connect four. I happen to be pretty good at connect four and don't know much about AI so it will be a hard challenge.

## Current Project Wish List
- Better read me
- Better evaluation function
  - Introduce the concept of "forced wins"
- Better search function (improved negamax search)
  - move ordering
  - alpha beta pruning
  - transpoistion tables
- Changelog
- A much more efficient win detection method in the ConnectFourBoard API
  - Might be able to use union find idk i dont really remember a lot about it

### Learning Resources
Although these are about chess, the content is still heavily applicable. The information on searching positions is really helpful, just not so much the info on evaluating them.
